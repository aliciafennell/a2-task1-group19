## Overview 

Testing... 

- **Summary** This report explores adult fish passage recorded from 2001-01-01 to 2010-12-31 at the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River, Oregon.  This report is focused on Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead species.  First, a time series graph visualized time series data by month and year to explore trends over the 10-year time period.  Second, a season plot is created to explore seasonal trends for each species.  Lastly, a total counts figure illustrates the total number of observed fish passage for each species over the 10-year period.

### Time series

```{r}

## Read in packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tsibble)

## Read in the data, keep only the columns of interest, replace "NA" with 0, and clean names

  select("Date", "Coho", "Jack.Coho", "Steelhead") %>%

## Convert to tsibble 
fish_ts <- fish_af %>%

# ggplot() +
#   geom_line(data = fish_ts, aes(x = date, y = coho)) +
#   labs(x = "Date",
#        y = "Number of Coho")

## Make data frames for each fish by monthyears

## Summary

- bulletpoint 2
=======


**Figure 1.3** Annual toal Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead passage observation were recorded at the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River (Oregon) from 2001-2010. Data were shared by and accessed from Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time).

**Summary**

- From 2001 to 2010, Steelhead observations showed a steady decline, with a small rebound between 2009-2010.

- Coho observations increased drastically, from ~5,000/year to ~25,000/year in 2009.

- Jack Coho observations remained relatively consistent over the 10-year period.
